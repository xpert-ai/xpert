**Xpert AI** is an open-source enterprise-level AI system that perfectly integrates two major platforms: agent orchestration and data analysis.

## üí° What's New

**üöÄ XpertAI 3.6 is here!**

This release introduces a complete **Knowledge Pipeline** system ‚Äî from creation, orchestration, authorization, and publishing to continuous knowledgebase management ‚Äî enabling teams to visually build reliable knowledge production workflows.
The **plugin system** is now a native part of the pipeline, allowing seamless integration with external data sources, document processors, and OCR tools through system integrations or the plugin marketplace.
With the new **Parent-Child Chunk Tree** structure and **Trigger Nodes**, XpertAI 3.6 delivers smarter document understanding and contextual retrieval. Secure data access via **environment variables or unified integrations**, and publish pipelines directly into the **Digital Expert Ecosystem** for automated, scalable knowledge operations.

## Agent-Workflow Hybrid Architecture

In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving AI landscape, enterprises face a key challenge: **How to balance the creativity of LLMs with the stability of workflows**? Pure agent architectures are flexible but hard to control; traditional workflows are reliable but lack adaptability. Xpert AI‚Äôs **Agent-Workflow Hybrid Architecture** is designed to resolve this conflict, enabling AI to have ‚Äúfree will‚Äù while adhering to ‚Äúrule-based order.‚Äù
