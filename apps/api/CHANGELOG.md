## 3.10.1

### Patch Changes

- d18aa7f: Allow up to 128 exact relative file paths in explicit Agent output deliveries, for
  both individual files and archives. Keep relative-path validation and wildcard
  rejection unchanged.

  Extract the existing 10 MiB Assistant workspace upload limit into a shared server
  constant so runtime adapters can reuse it without depending on the HTTP controller.
  This does not change upload size or workspace access checks.

- b86bba1: Add resumable personal Bosi onboarding with tenant, organization and user isolation, private workspace preparation, workspace service connections, capability-aware model selection and recoverable template installation. Reuse existing Assistant bindings and persist initialization and welcome progress.

  Add authorized public Assistant name and avatar updates, a Desktop appearance studio with configurable characters, uploaded images and pets, and ChatKit appearance and computer controls. Preserve published configuration when saving profile fields and keep Assistant capability changes behind explicit settings saves.

- b86bba1: Bundle shared model profiles for Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Aider, Qwen Code, Kimi and CodeBuddy, with a pinned toolchain and cloud-coding skill. Route shell-driven coding work through execution-scoped platform model access and enable coding tools with default policies.

  Load the optional local-shell sandbox plugin when explicitly configured and align its registration metadata with its package release. Keep sandbox service discovery passive and distinguish configuration errors from unavailable services.

- ada086b: Declare jsdom as a direct Desktop development dependency so isolated installer builds can run the renderer tests without relying on transitive server dependencies. Regenerate the Desktop dependency lock for reproducible CI installs.

  Use ES2020-compatible quote escaping for execution usage CSV exports so the Web production build succeeds without raising its browser library target.

  Exclude test-support directories from the server-ai production compilation so Jest mocks remain available to tests without entering API build output.

- b86bba1: Add execution-scoped model grants, protocol bridges, CLI launchers, budget enforcement, attributed usage settlement and audited reconciliation. Expose the native model SDK and scoped host runner capability, and accept CLI prompt-cache hints without forwarding provider credentials to execution environments.

  Add typed Agent execution results, authorized file delivery and bounded task observation. Preserve background execution during logout, centralize conversation file access, retain explicit Assistant middleware configuration, and allow validated text-only receipts from image-capable tools. Include the API and Web releases required by these shared contracts and runtime changes.

- f5add6a: Remove the ModelExecution per-request input cap and the byte/token comparison from
  Chat, native and bridged CLI requests. Read and discard legacy maxInputTokens in
  persisted policies and grants. Reserve estimated request tokens plus output against
  cumulative budgets; settle using provider usage facts as before.

  Expose the selected model's catalog context window to CLI profiles instead of deriving
  it from tenant input limits. Custom CLI profiles must migrate from limits.maxInputTokens
  to optional model.contextWindow. Upgrade the host and profiles together and start a new
  execution to regenerate CLI configuration.

  Remove the extra output cap and fixed Qwen/CodeBuddy turn caps. Use optional catalog
  output metadata for CLI configuration, make execution token budgets explicit opt-ins,
  and distinguish rate/concurrency errors from budget exhaustion. Honor active response
  streams using an inactivity timer, and do not recover live grants as lost workers solely
  because their calls are old. Republished Assistant versions no longer invalidate an
  otherwise authorized execution.

- b86bba1: Provide a shared CQRS entry point for resolving user organization access, keeping role-specific access policy out of business callers. Add a reusable Zod request-validation pipe and skip plugin schema synchronization when a plugin declares no entities.

## 3.10.0

### Minor Changes

- e4485ba: Release Bosi Desktop, API and Webapp together for configurable digital experts.

  Bosi can create blank assistants and edit their model, optional capabilities and instructions. Personal profile overrides remain local, while shared assistant settings require workspace edit access and take effect after publishing.

  Add an extensible Assistant capability registry, model and runtime compatibility checks, and configuration APIs with stale-edit protection. Keep cloud computer support in the Pro capability provider, and preserve existing workflow settings when managed capabilities change.

- 99d09ec: Release a coordinated minor update across all Xpert workspace packages, including the API, Web and Bosi applications, shared SDK and contracts, backend and UI libraries, bundled plugins, sandbox runtimes and documentation.

### Patch Changes

- 79cc75a: Publish application Docker images only for their own Changesets. Build scoped candidates, require consumed Changesets for stable releases, and check that shared package releases include their consuming applications.
- ce73ebe: Upgrade the shared ChatKit packages to 0.8.0 across the API, Web and Bosi desktop applications.
- 7108a25: Publish API and Web candidates together for the shared execution-navigation contract changes.
