Extend the existing api_key table and authentication flow with USER-bound personal keys in account settings, with one-time secret display, hashed storage, expiration and revocation. Use the same endpoints and authentication flow as existing API keys, restoring the personal key's human owner and current permissions. Preserve ordinary login-only management endpoints and the existing resource-key and ChatKit session flows; no personal-key-specific route opt-in is required.

Instances that tested the separate-table draft can preserve those credentials with the one-time `packages/server/src/api-key/personal-api-key/migrate-personal-api-keys.sql` script after schema synchronization.
