# Agent invocation runtime

The functional design and rollout sequence are in
[Unified Agent Invocation](../../../../docs/plans/2026-09-22-unified-agent-invocation.md).

- `AgentInvocationRuntime`: authorization, idempotency, pinned strategies and compare-and-swap state transitions.
- `TypeOrmAgentInvocationStore`: state and append-only observation history in one transaction.
- `AgentInvocationFactoryService`: scoped plugin capability and workspace binding resolution.
- `AgentInvocationGraphService` / `NativeAgentCompiler`: native graph compatibility, ordinary tool wrapping and workflow calls.
- `assistant-task-adapter`: compatible background task transport, without facade recursion.
- `invocation-wait`: durable graph pause/resume; no model-driven polling.

Apply `migrations/20260922-agent-invocation.sql` before deploying this host version.
No migration or service restart is performed by unit tests. External strategies
and their operator instructions live in `xpert-plugins/xpertai/integrations/agent-runtimes`.
